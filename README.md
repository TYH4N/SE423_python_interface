# SE423 Python Interface

This project is a visulization interface developed for UIUC SE423 course.

The interface includes:

1. A map for the course where obstacles and golf balls detected will be plotted, as well as the trace of the robot. 

2. Two interactive buttons (Clear and Stop), to clear the path of the robot and stop the GUI.

3. Two interactive text boxes where parameters can be set and send to the robot (Kp and Kd in the picture below). Additional parameters can be added. 

4. A text box to display the locations of the golf balls detected.
